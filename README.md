# Physics Playground Engine
Still working on exact details, but this will be a simple Physics engine that will evolve over time.  The tech is not finalized, but for now I am using C to handle graphics and Zig to handle the calculations.

I am debating adding Roc as a sort of scripting language to load senarios.
